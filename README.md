# weather-dashboard
Dynamic weather dashboard

# Description

* The weather dashboard is intended to provide the current weather and a five day forecast for any city that is searched.
* Recent searches should also be saved to local storage and displayed under the search bar.
* The UV index needs to be color coded so that the viewer can have a visual representation of how intense the UV index is or that day.

# Installation

* I used several functions that utilized the Open Weather Map API to display current and future weather conditions.
* There was two seperate API URLs used, one for the UV index and one for all the other data.
* I used a template literal to construct and display my five day forecast.
* I hard coded San Diego as the default location when the page is opened
 
 # Issues
 
 * This was the first time I used an ajax call inside of another ajax call, which was difficult.
 * Styling my cards that were created using a template literal also posed as a problem.
 * Lastly I am still in the learning process of using local storage.
